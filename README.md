**Eat-Da-Burger is an exercise in full stack development skills with a focus on Node.js, Express, Handlebars, and SQL.** I created this for the Coding Boot Camp at UNC-Chapel Hill in March 2019.

# Features
Uses Node, Express, Handlebars, SQL, an ORM, and an MVC design pattern. Node, Express and MySQL query and route the data, Handlebars is used to generate HTML. A JawsDB MySQL add-on supplies the SQL component in the Heroku deployment.

Users can "Add a Burger" by entering a burger name of their choosing. Users can click to "Devour this burger" on any burger that has been created and not yet devoured. Clicking "Devour..." moves the burger into the "Hall of Fame". "Gameplay" is not the point here, it's all about the internal workings and interplay of the front-end, server-side, and SQL components.
